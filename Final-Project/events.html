                Join us for a conversation with author Scott Branson & Dean Spade!

With examples enriched by history and theory, Practical Anarchism will empower you to break free from the consumerist trappings of our world, detach from patriarchal masculinity, norms of family, gender, sexuality, racialization, the destruction of our planet, and embrace ideas of sustainable living, with ties of mutual-aid, and collective liberation.

This is an all ages event and masks are required.

                In Family Abolition , author M.E. O'Brien uncovers the history of struggles to create radical alternatives to the private family. From early Marxists to Black and queer insurrectionists to today's mass protest movements, O'Brien finds revolutionaries seeking better ways of loving, caring, and living.

"[Family Abolition is] an immensely useful book that will help us not just understand the violence of gender and family relations, but also take action to establish new methods of caring for one another and building survivable social relations."-Dean Spade

Join author M.E. O'Brien in conversation with Joseph DeFilippis and Shannon Perez-Darby Drawing on their organizing around the politics of social welfare, DeFilippis and Shannon-Darby will engage how Family Abolition resonates with their own work and thinking.

This is an all ages event and masks are required.
